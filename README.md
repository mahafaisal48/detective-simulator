### Detective Simluator

- ## Introduction:
Detective Simulator is a C++ murder mystery game developed as our Object-Oriented Programming final project. Players take on the role of a detective, choose a character and difficulty level, investigate crime scenes, interrogate suspects, gather evidence, and analyze clues to identify the true culprit. The project was designed to apply core OOP principles while creating an engaging, interactive mystery-solving experience. It also includes an optional graphical version built with Raylib and Raygui.

- ## Game Flow
1. 🧑 Choose Detective Profile
The user is shown multiple detective profiles (e.g., with different names, skills, or backstories).
User selects any 1 of the 4 profiles they want to use or play as.

2. 🎚️ Select Difficulty Level
The player chooses the game difficulty:
Easy: Clear clues, fewer suspects
Medium: Some misleading clues
Hard: Many red herrings and complex alibis

3. 📁 Case Setup
A case is randomly loaded or selected, which includes:
Case title and description
Suspects with profiles and alibis
Rooms containing objects (some hide evidence)
The killer is secretly selected by the game

4. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 View Suspects
Show a list of all suspects (name and age).

Player can select a suspect to:
View full details (name, age, motive, background)
Choose to interrogate, revealing their alibi:
Where they were
When
Who saw them
What they were doing

5. 🏠 Search Rooms
Show a list of rooms in the house.
Player selects a room to:
View the room's name and a list of objects

Select objects to investigate:
Objects may contain clues
Clues may support or contradict alibis

6. 🧾 Review Found Evidence
Show a list of all discovered objects that contain clues which will be considered as an evidence.
Player uses evidence to spot contradictions in suspects’ stories.
